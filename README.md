## Odin Recipes Project

A simple HTML based project where I created a recipe website as part of The Odin Project.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the following:

### Linux CLI
- Creating directories and files using basic commands
- Navigating between directories
- Opening files in VS Code directly through terminal

### Git and Github Workflow
- Creating a repository in github and cloning it on local machine
- Adding and commiting changes to version control
- Pushing code to remote respository
- Viewing the project live on Github Pages

### HTML Basics
- Understanding and using the html boilerplate
- Working with headings and paragraphs
- Implementing ordered and unordered list
- Adding images and relative links

### Live Demo

  This project helped strengthen my foundational web development and version control skills!!
