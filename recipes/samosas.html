         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>For dough, add refined flour, semolina, salt, carom seeds and ghee, in a mixing bowl, mix well until combined well, make sure to crush the ajwain between your palms to enhance the flavour, the texture should be somewhere similar to breadcrumbs & should stick when pressed.
                Add cold water gradually in the flour and knead a stiff & tight dough, knead the dough well for 7-8 minutes, after kneading cover the dough with a damp cloth and rest for 30 minutes. By the time you can prepare the filling.</li>
            <li>For filling, we need to make the ginger & green chilli paste, for that, add green chillies & ginger in a grinding jar and grind into a fine paste, keep the paste aside to be used later in making the filling.</li>
            <li>Further, take a mortar & pestle, add cumin seeds, coriander seeds, & fennel seeds and grind to a coarse powder, you can also grind the spices in a mixer grinder, keep the powder aside to be used later in making the filling.</li>
            <li>Cut the boiled potatoes in quarters and further slice them, keep aside for making filling.</li>
            <li>Set a pan or a wok on low heat, add ghee, further add the grounded spices & briefly cook on low heat for 30-40 seconds, now add the ginger chilli paste, stir & cook for 1-2 minutes on low flame, further add the boiled potatoes, green peas, salt & pepper to taste, chaat masala, kasuri methi and freshly chopped coriander leaves, stir well to mix the potatoes and the masala well.</li>
            <li>Increase the flame to medium high & cook the potatoes for 6-7 minutes, it should get some colour while cooking, mash the potatoes lightly while keeping a few chunks intact. Further transfer the mixture in a bowl and allow it to cool down to room temperature. As the filling is ready, you can make the samosa.</li>
            <li>For making samosa, make the samosa sheets, for that, knead the dough once again that has been resting & divide in equal size dough balls, further flatten the dough balls in thin sheets, making an oval shape, make sure the sheet is not too thin or too thick, divide the sheet width wise in two equal halves. Roll the sheet once again after cutting, as the sheet may shrink a little bit. </li>
            <li>Pick one sheet & apply water on the edge of the straight line, bring the ends together and seal well to shape like a cone, fill sufficient amount of aloo filling, while lightly pressing downwards, bring the openings of the samosa together and seal properly to shape a proper samosa. Shape all the samosa in the same way, make sure to cover with a cloth while you’re shaping other samosa. By the time you can set oil for deep frying.</li>
            <li>For frying, set oil in a big kadhai for deep frying, make sure the kadhai should be wide enough, heat the oil on medium heat and drop in the samosa, fry the samosa on medium heat until they are crisp and golden brown in colour, make sure to fry the samosa in batches but in good quantity that the kadhai is filled but do not overcrowd, make sure the oil should not be too hot, fry the samosa on low to medium flame the samosas are perfectly cooked from inside, adjust the flame accordingly, if you have a thermometer, fry the samosa at 140 ℃ - 150 ℃.</li>
            <li>Your crispy hot samosas are ready, you can serve as it is with the chutneys of your choice, salted fried green chillies & a cup of chai.</li>
